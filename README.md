## What is Notabilia Graph?

***This chart basically shows “Chronological Binary Outcomes”.***
***Each segment of a thread shows some sort of event, which is ordered chronologically.***
***Each segment is then double-encoded using color and angle to indicate one of two possible outcomes.***
***In the case of the Wikipedia data, those outcomes are Deletion Recommendation or Keep/Merge/Redirect Recommendation.***

### How to understand the visualization?

***Discussions are represented by a thread starting at the bottom center.***
***Each time a user recommends to keep the article, a green segment leaning towards the left is added.***
***Each time a user recommends to delete the article, a red segment leaning towards the right is added.***
***As the discussion progresses, the length of the segments as well as the angle slowly decay.***

**3 TYPES**

***Controversial - opinions balance each other***
***Swinging - similar opinions over time***
***Unanimous - one opinion stands out***
